=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With L<Template::Toolkit>-like engines, you instantiate I<one> engine to
process I<multiple> templates.
With L<Text::Template>, you instantiate I<one> engine to process I<one>
template.
This class is a simple wrapper around Text::Template to simplify its use as a
template engine in L<Dancer2>. It basically just manage Text::Template
instances (and their expiration) through L<CHI>.

You can give this engine templates as filenames or string references:

=for :list
* with a filename, the corresponding file will be read by L<Text::Template>;
* a string ref will be dereferenced and its content used as the template
  content itself.

=for :comment

This is our cache. We should gather CHI-related options from config.yml to
support other caching methods like Memcached. That sounds overkill to me, but
an open interface is always better than a predefined one!

=cut

has _cache => (
    is      => 'rwp',
    isa     => InstanceOf['CHI::Driver'],
    lazy    => 1,
    builder => '_build_cache',
);

sub _build_cache {
    my $self = shift;
    return CHI->new(
        driver             => 'Memory',    # THIS should be generalized
        expires_on_backend => 1,
        global             => 1,           # CHI::Driver::Memory-specific
    );
}

=attr caching

Whether a cache should be used for storing Text::Template instances, or not.

Defaults to C<1> (caching enabled).

=cut

has caching => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => Bool,
    default => 1,
);

=attr expires

How longer (in seconds) the a Text::Template instance will stay in the cache.
After this duration, when the corresponding template is requested again, a new
Text::Template instance will be created (and cached).

Defaults to C<3600> (one hour).
Obviously irrelevant if C<caching> is set to C<0>!

=cut

has expires => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => Int,
    default => 3600,
);

=attr delimiters

An arrayref of (two) delimiters, as defined in L<Text::Template#new>.

Defaults to C<< [ '{', '}' ] >>.

=cut

has delimiters => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => ArrayRef[Str],
    default => sub { [ '{', '}' ] },
);

=attr cache_stringrefs

If this attribute and C<caching> are true (which is the default),
string-ref-templates will always be cached forever (since they cannot become
I<invalid>, contrary to template files that can be changed on disc when
FakeEngine doesn't watch).

However, you may want to disable this behavior for string-ref-templates if you
use a lot of such templates only once (they would fill your cache). By setting
C<cache_stringrefs> to C<0>, you tell FakeEngine not to cache (at all) your
string-ref-templates.

=cut

has cache_stringrefs => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => Bool,
    default => 1,
);

=method process( $template, \%tokens )

Computes the C<$template> according to specified C<\%tokens>.

If C<$template> is a string, it is taken as a filename for the template file
(if this file does not exist, the method C<croak>s). If C<$template> is a
scalar reference, it is taken as a reference to a string that contains the
template. In any other case, this method will C<croak> furiously.

Note that, if C<caching> is true, (dereferenced) string references will be
cached too.

This methods simply gets a Text::Template instance (either from cache or by
instantiating it) and calls C<< Text::Template::fill_in( HASH => \%tokens ) >>
on it, returning the result.

If an error occurs in Text::Template, this method returns C<undef>, sets
C<Dancer2::Template::TextTemplate::FakeEngine::ERROR> to the value of
C<Text::Template::ERROR> and does not cache anything.
