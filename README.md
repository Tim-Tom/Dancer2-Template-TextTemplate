# NAME

Dancer2::Template::TextTemplate - Text::Template engine for Dancer2

# VERSION

version 0.2

# SYNOPSIS

To use this engine, you may configure [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2) via `config.yml`:

    template: text_template

# DESCRIPTION

__This is an alpha version: it basically works, but it has not been
extensively tested and it misses interesting features.__

This template engine allows you to use [Text::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template) in [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2).

Contrary to other template engines (like [Template::Toolkit](https://metacpan.org/pod/Template::Toolkit)), where _one_
instance may work on _multiple_ templates, _one_ [Text::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template) instance
is created _for each_ template. Therefore, if:

- you don't use a huge amount of different templates;
- you don't use each template just once;

then it may be interesting to __cache__ Text::Template instances for later use.
Since these conditions seem to be common, this engine uses a cache (_via_
[CHI](https://metacpan.org/pod/CHI)) __by default__.

If you're OK with caching, you should specify a __timeout__ (`expires`) after
which cached Text::Template instances are to be refreshed, since you might
have changed your template sources without restarting Dancer2. Use the value
`0` to tell the engine that templates never expire.

To enable caching in your `config.yml`:

    template: text_template
    engines:
        text_template:
            caching: 1                  # default
            expires: 3600               # in seconds; default; 0 to disable
            cache_stringrefs: 1         # default
            delimiters: [ "{", "}" ]    # default

Just like with [Dancer2::Template::Toolkit](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Template::Toolkit), you can pass templates either as
filenames (for a template file) or string references ("string-refs", which are
dereferenced and used as the template's content). In some cases, you may want
to disable caching just for string-refs: for instance, if you generate a lot
of templates on-the-fly and use them only once, caching them is useless and
fills your cache. You can therefore disable caching for string-refs only by
setting `cache_stringrefs` to `0`.

The `delimiters` option allows you to specify a custom delimiters pair
(opening and closing) for your templates. See the [Text::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template)
documentation for more about delimiters, since this module just pass them to
Text::Template. This option defaults to `{` and `}`, meaning that in `a
{b} c`, `b` (and only `b`) will be interpolated.

# METHODS

## render( $template, \\%tokens )

Renders the template.

- `$template` is either a (string) filename for the template file or a

    reference to a string that contains the template.

- `\%tokens` is a hashref for the tokens you wish to pass to

    [Text::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template) for rendering, as if you were using
    `Text::Template::fill_in`.

[Carp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Croak)s if an error occurs.
